00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:06,825
Wi-Fi Enhanced Connectivity makes
it easy to switch to Wi-Fi

2
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:09,014
when you’re using
a lot of data.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:11,289
Watch this video to learn
about this feature

4
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:16,644
on your Samsung Galaxy
Tab 4 10.1 from Verizon.

5
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:21,781
Your tablet has Wi-Fi Enhanced
Connectivity automatically turned on.

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:26,840
To see how it works, let’s open
the Play Store as an example.

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,237
From your Home screen,

8
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:32,317
tap the Apps icon at the
bottom right of your screen.

9
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:38,229
Then, scroll to and
tap Play Store.

10
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:43,056
You are instantly notified that you
can connect to a Wi-Fi network.

11
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,711
Select the network you
want to connect to,

12
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:52,538
 or tap Not now if you wish to continue
to use your mobile data connection.

13
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:55,111
If you want to turn
this feature off,

14
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,889
open the Notification Panel

15
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:01,909
by touching and sliding down
from the top of the screen.

16
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,136
 Tap the Settings icon.

17
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:11,238
Tap Wi-Fi to see
your Wi-Fi settings.

18
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:15,627
Then tap Show Wi-Fi
pop-up to turn it off.

19
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:18,025
You won’t be reminded
about switching to Wi-Fi

20
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:22,006
when opening apps that
might use a lot of data.

21
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,610
Press the Home button
to leave Settings.

22
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:28,566
 Another feature of Wi-Fi
Enhanced connectivity

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,044
is that when a Wi-Fi network you’ve
connected to before is in range,

24
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,980
you’ll be automatically
connected.
